## Stronghold into a StrongHome - 60 xp 
Victory Point Subsystem-

The stronghold is attacked by hordes of villagers or passerby every four hours, assuming they don't deal with the leaders of these attacks. They saw them once, only after beating one of the hordes, but that meeting resulted in the death of a guard vice-captain

#### Great Success: 11+ points

The survivors are prepared for hell, high water and probably a minor apocalypse. They are capable of supplying adventurers with food the entire time they are here and have enough defenses prepped to injure the hordes long before they arrive. Any shambler troop comes in with 30 less hit points. 

#### Success: 6-10 points

Although tight on some things, the stronghold can provide edible albeit not immense food for the party and can defend themselves to a decent degree. Unless a large threat arrives, they can weather the storm.

#### Failure: 3-5 points

Regrettably, food and bodies are both tight. You'll survive but not for an extended stay. Food supplies mean there's a timer of a week unless the pathfinders want to risk going out. Defenses are functional but would falter easily. 1 additional shambler troop will arrive but with only 30 hp.

#### Critical Failure: less than 3 points

Hope is nearly lost. Despite the efforts of the pathfinders, morale is at rock bottom. Food supplies are nonexistant, weapons less than that and an attack could easily result in mass deaths. The players will fight 2 shambler troops instead of 1 to represent the inability of the base to defend itself.

## Hordes at the gates- a trivial, followed by a hard encounter (150xp)

- 2 [Withered](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=1922) (60 a pop, 120xp)
