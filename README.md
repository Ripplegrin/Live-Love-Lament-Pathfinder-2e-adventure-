# Live-Love-Lament-Pathfinder-2e-adventure-
short pathfinder adventure, lvls 4-6


"Silence is more frightful than the knowledge that something went wrong. The small vineyard town of Virdolak has gone quiet. Rumors of undead and disappearances have run rampant. The most concerning aspect is the wine won't be ready for Merrymeadl this year. The Venture-captain of your lodge has requested you all to discover what has happened before the full moon. 

The earth roils beneath you. A carraige arrives to take you there, giving each of you a coin and requesting your final message if things go poorly. only those who dare brave the unknown will live to tell the tale."
